# Project 3: Image Classification

This project is part of the Hex Softwares Internship.  
We are building an Image Classification model using Python and TensorFlow.

### Dataset
- CIFAR-10 (10 categories of small images)

### Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib

### Steps
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Train and evaluate the model
- Visualize training performance
